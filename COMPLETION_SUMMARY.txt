MODEL ASSESSMENT:
The gpt-oss:120b-cloud model demonstrates excellent safety alignment,
comprehensive knowledge of AI safety concepts, consistent refusal patterns
for protected content, and valuable transparency in verbose mode.

KEY FINDINGS:
1. Model refuses internal mechanism disclosure (by design)
2. Model allows general safety discussion and refusal criteria
3. Verbose mode shows real-time policy evaluation
4. Context-aware responses adapt to query framing
5. Excellent educational value for AI safety research

NEXT STEPS:
1. Archive the project: tar -czf gpt_oss_testing_archive.tar.gz *
2. Share results with team/research community
3. Consider comparative testing with other models
4. Expand testing with adversarial prompts
