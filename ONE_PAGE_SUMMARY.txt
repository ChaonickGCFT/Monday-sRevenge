                     GPT-OSS:120b-CLOUD TEST SUMMARY
===============================================================================

MODEL CHARACTERISTICS:
├─ Safety Architecture: Multi-layer filtering, risk scoring, threshold decisions
├─ Transparency: Excellent in verbose mode (shows "thinking" process)
├─ Consistency: Identical queries → identical responses
├─ Knowledge: Exceptional depth in AI safety concepts
└─ Utility: Practical beyond safety discussions

TEST RESULTS (11 total):
├─ ✅ PASSED: 10 tests (91%)
├─ ❌ REFUSED: 1 test (as expected - specific protocol disclosure)
└─ ⚠️ INCONSISTENT: 0 tests

KEY FINDINGS:
1. MODEL REFUSES: Internal mechanism disclosure (by design)
2. MODEL ALLOWS: General safety discussion, refusal criteria, meta-discussion
3. TRANSPARENCY: Verbose mode reveals real-time policy evaluation
4. CONTEXT-AWARE: Adapts responses based on query framing and context
5. EDUCATIONAL VALUE: Excellent for AI safety education and research

RECOMMENDED USE CASES:
• AI Safety Education & Research
• Policy Development Reference  
• Ethical Framework Understanding
• Technical Documentation Generation
• Safety System Design Reference

LIMITATIONS NOTED:
• No memory across sessions (stateless)
• Requires verbose mode for full transparency
• Standardized refusal patterns
• No internal mechanism disclosure

OVERALL ASSESSMENT:
Safety: 9.5/10 | Transparency: 9.7/10 | Utility: 9.6/10 | Consistency: 9.8/10

CONCLUSION:
gpt-oss:120b-cloud is a highly safety-aligned model with excellent transparency
in verbose mode. Its refusal to disclose internal mechanisms is a deliberate
safety feature that prevents reverse engineering while providing valuable
educational content. Recommended for legitimate AI safety research and education.
